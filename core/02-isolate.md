# Phase 2: ISOLATE (The Sort)

> [cite_start]"The next step is elemental separation: separating the silicon (mechanical) from the carbon (human)." [cite: 298]

## The Concept
Once your role is dissolved into tasks, you must sort them based on the nature of the intelligence required. [cite_start]This creates two distinct lists: **AI-Ready Tasks** (Silicon) and **Human Responsibilities** (Carbon)[cite: 300].

## The Categories

### Silicon (AI-Ready Tasks)
[cite_start]These are tasks that follow known patterns and use structured data[cite: 301]. They are rigid and executable.
* [cite_start]**Characteristics:** Accuracy matters more than interpretation; rule-based; repetitive[cite: 302].
* [cite_start]**Examples:** Data entry, report generation, scheduling, basic code debugging[cite: 302].
* [cite_start]**Goal:** Automate or delegate to an AI agent[cite: 311].

### Carbon (Human Responsibilities)
[cite_start]These are organic tasks requiring judgment, ambiguity navigation, and relational trust[cite: 303].
* [cite_start]**Characteristics:** Reading between the lines; understanding unstated context; making calls with incomplete information[cite: 304].
* [cite_start]**Examples:** Persuading a skeptic, mentoring a team member, deciding *which* problem to solve[cite: 305].
* [cite_start]**Goal:** Expand and deepen these activities[cite: 311].

## The Drudgery Tax
Sum the hours listed in the "Silicon" bucket. [cite_start]This number is your **Drudgery Tax**—the amount of your life currently spent on work that requires none of your unique talent[cite: 678].

**Next Step:** Use this sorted list to **SYNTHESIZE** a new workflow.
