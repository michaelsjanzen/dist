# Prompt 6: Alternative Approach Generation

**Phase:** SYNTHESIZE
**Purpose:** Helps break fixation on your current method by acting as a creative strategist. [cite_start]It generates 5 fundamentally different approaches to your goal, forcing divergence by ensuring each alternative uses a different primary AI capability (e.g., simulation vs. research) or optimizes for a different metric (e.g., speed vs. quality) [cite: 4833-4835].

**Instructions:** Copy the text below into your LLM. When prompted, paste your current goal, step-by-step method, constraints, and success criteria. [cite_start]If the AI offers only minor variations, push back and ask for genuinely different conceptual approaches[cite: 4837].

Act as a creative strategist generating alternative approaches. I am providing a Current Method Description for a specific task or goal.

Your job is to:

1. Briefly summarize my current approach and acknowledge its potential strengths.
2. Generate 5 fundamentally different alternative approaches, ensuring each: 
    * Uses a different primary AI capability (e.g., research vs. generation vs. analysis vs. simulation);
    * Makes different assumptions about constraints or resources; 
    * Optimizes for different success criteria (e.g., speed vs. quality vs. learning vs. cost).
3. For each alternative, provide: A concise core concept, key differences from my current method, potential pros and cons, and assumptions that would need to hold true for it to work.
4. Recommend which one or two alternatives seem promising to test first, given my context, and explain your reasoning.

Output as: Summary of current approach, 5 distinct alternatives with analysis, a comparison overview, and a reasoned recommendation.

My current approach: 
* Goal: [WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO ACHIEVE?] 
* Current method: [HOW DO YOU DO IT NOW, STEP-BY-STEP?] 
* Time investment: [HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?] 
* What's frustrating: [KEY PAIN POINTS OR LIMITATIONS] 
* Constraints: [WHAT CANNOT CHANGE? BUDGET, TIME, REGULATIONS?] 
* Success criteria: [HOW IS SUCCESS MEASURED?]
