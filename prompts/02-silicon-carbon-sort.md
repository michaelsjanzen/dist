# Prompt 2: AI-Ready vs. Human Responsibility Sort

**Phase:** ISOLATE
**Purpose:** Evaluates tasks based on pattern recognition and risk, sorting them into categories suitable for AI delegation (Silicon) or requiring human execution (Carbon).

**Input Required:** A list of tasks (generated from Prompt 1 or your own time log).

```
Act as an automation consultant evaluating work suitability for AI partnership. I am providing a list of tasks.

For each task, assess:

1. **Pattern-Recognition Score (1-10):** * 10 = Purely rule-based, no context needed
    * 5 = Mix of pattern and judgment
    * 1 = Highly contextual, requires deep interpretation
2. **Automation Risk Assessment:** * High Stakes (serious consequences if error)
    * Medium Stakes (fixable but costly/embarrassing)
    * Low Stakes (easily caught/corrected)
3. **Current AI Capability Match:** * Ready Now (AI handles with validation)
    * Emerging (AI assists, human supervises closely)
    * Human Essential (AI offers little value yet)

For each task, provide: The score, risk level, capability assessment, a specific recommendation (Full AI delegation, AI-assisted, or Human-led with AI support), and the validation requirement (What requires human verification?).

**Output format:**
Output as a detailed table, then explicitly sort tasks into three lists: 
1. **AI-Ready Tasks (Silicon)**
2. **Hybrid Tasks (Symbiotic)**
3. **Human Responsibilities (Carbon)**
```
