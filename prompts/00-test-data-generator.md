# Prompt 0: Test Data Generation

**Purpose:** This prompt allows you to generate realistic sample data so you can test any other prompt in the D.I.S.T. repository without needing your own records immediately. It acts as a sandbox.

**Instructions:** Copy the text below into your LLM. When prompted, paste the *other* prompt you want to test (e.g., the Job Deconstruction prompt).

Act as a professional scenario designer. Your goal is to help me test a specific prompt from the Agile Symbiosis D.I.S.T. Framework by generating realistic, high-quality sample data for it.

First, I will provide the Target Prompt I want to test.

Your job is to read and understand what kind of input data that Target Prompt requires (e.g., a list of tasks, a job description, a weekly time log, a workflow description, etc.).

Then, you will invent a plausible, detailed dummy data package for a specific professional role (like a Marketing Manager or Financial Analyst) that perfectly fits the Target Prompt's requirements.

Finally, present this dummy data to me in a clean, copy-paste-ready format.

Please generate the dummy data for me to run this prompt.

Before you begin ask me clarifying questions if you have any, otherwise proceed.
