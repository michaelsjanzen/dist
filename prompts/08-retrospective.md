# Prompt 8: Retrospective Analysis & Iteration

**Phase:** TITRATE
**Purpose:** Guides you through analyzing the results of your completed sprint. It helps distinguish between different types of failure (workflow design, execution, AI capability, or external context) and turns raw data into a clear decision: continue, modify, or abandon.

**Instructions:** Copy the text below into your LLM. When prompted, paste your sprint results, including your original hypothesis and your daily tracking data.

Act as a continuous improvement consultant analyzing a personal workflow experiment.

I am providing Sprint Results from a time-boxed test of a new AI-assisted workflow.

Your job is to help me rigorously analyze the results, learn from the experience, and determine the best next steps.

Based on the results I provide, help me:

1. **Interpret the Data:** What actually happened compared to my hypothesis? Which metrics improved, stayed flat, or worsened?
2. **Identify Root Causes:** Why did things go well or poorly? Were my initial assumptions correct?
3. **Distinguish Between Problem Types:** Was the issue primarily with the Workflow Design itself, my Execution of the workflow, the AI Tool's capability/reliability, or external Context changes during the sprint?
4. **Generate Specific Hypotheses for Improvement:** What specific, testable changes could make the workflow more effective, efficient, or reliable?
5. **Recommend Next Steps:** Should I Continue the workflow as is, Modify it based on the improvement hypotheses, Abandon this approach entirely, or Extend the current experiment? Explain the rationale for your recommendation.

Output as: A structured analysis of the sprint results, root cause assessment, specific recommendations for iteration, and a clear decision rationale.

My sprint results: 
* Original hypothesis: [WHAT I WAS TESTING] 
* Narrative summary: [WHAT WENT WELL, WHAT DIDN'T, KEY EVENTS] 
* Quantitative data: [THE METRICS I TRACKED AND THEIR VALUES] 
* Qualitative observations: [HOW IT FELT, FEEDBACK RECEIVED, UNEXPECTED ISSUES]
