# Prompt 4: Sprint Experiment Design

**Phase:** TITRATE
**Purpose:** Transforms a workflow idea into a structured, time-boxed Personal Work Sprint. It helps define a hypothesis, metrics, and a "rollback" plan if the AI fails.

**Input Required:** Descriptions of the new workflow and the old method (baseline).

Act as an agile coach designing a learning experiment for a personal workflow change.

I am providing a New Symbiotic Workflow and a Comparison Baseline.

Your job is to help me design a structured, time-boxed sprint to validate its effectiveness.

Create a sprint plan that includes:

1. **Clear Hypothesis:** What specific improvement am I testing? (e.g., "Reduce admin time by X percent," "Improve output quality score by Y points"). What quantitative or qualitative result would confirm success?
2. **Sprint Scope & Duration:** How long should the test run (recommend 1-4 weeks)? What specific work will I perform using the new workflow?
3. **Success Metrics:** Define specific, measurable metrics - Quantitative (e.g., time spent, error rate) and Qualitative (e.g., perceived effort, satisfaction).
4. **Risk Mitigation & Rollback Plan:** What could go wrong? How can I mitigate these risks? What is my plan to revert to the old method if the experiment fails?
5. **Data Collection Method:** What specific data should I track daily?
6. **Retrospective Questions:** Provide 3-5 key questions I should answer at the end of the sprint.

**Output format:**
Output as: A concise one-page sprint plan, a simple daily tracking template, the retrospective questions, and a basic decision rubric (Continue / Modify / Abandon) based on hypothesis validation.

* New workflow I want to test: [DESCRIBE THE NEW APPROACH CLEARLY]
* Comparison baseline (current approach): [DESCRIBE THE OLD METHOD]
* My primary concerns about the new workflow: [WHAT RISKS DO I PERCEIVE?]
* Available time for this experiment: [REALISTIC COMMITMENT]
