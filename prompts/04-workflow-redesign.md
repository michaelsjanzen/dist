# Prompt 4: Transformative Workflow Redesign

**Phase:** SYNTHESIZE
**Purpose:** Acts as a workflow innovation consultant to generate faster or higher-impact approaches. It proposes a "symbiotic workflow" where AI handles pattern-matching, leaving you with strategic judgment.

**Input Required:** A description of a specific high-value task, your current process steps, and major pain points.

Act as a workflow innovation consultant applying transformative thinking to knowledge work redesign in the Age of AI.

I am providing a Current Workflow Description for a specific high-value task.

Your job is to:

1. **Analyze** the current workflow, identifying bottlenecks, repetitive patterns, waste (non-value-added steps), and dependencies.
2. **Challenge** the core constraints by asking "What if...?": 
    * What if data collection/research were instant? 
    * What if first drafts were automatic?
    * What if you had unlimited expert assistance for routine parts?
3. **Design** a fundamentally different workflow where AI partners handle: All pattern-based execution, first-draft generation, research and data aggregation.
4. **Explicitly specify** where uniquely human judgment, creativity, or strategic decision-making remains essential in the new workflow.
5. **Estimate** the potential cycle time improvement (vs. current).
6. **Identify key risks** introduced by the new workflow and outline necessary human validation steps to mitigate them.

**Output format:**
Output as: A map of the current workflow (with time estimates), the proposed new symbiotic workflow (clearly marking AI vs. Human steps), a comparison highlighting potential gains, a human validation checklist, and a list of risks/failure modes.

My current workflow: 
* Task/Responsibility: [WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH?]
* Current process: [DESCRIBE STEP-BY-STEP, INCLUDING TIME ESTIMATES]
* Major pain points: [WHAT IS MOST FRUSTRATING/SLOW?]
* Quality requirements: [WHAT DOES SUCCESS LOOK LIKE?]
* Constraints: [DEADLINES, REGULATIONS, DEPENDENCIES]
```
