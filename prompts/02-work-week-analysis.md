Act as a time management consultant analyzing real work patterns.

I am providing a Detailed Work Log from the past week.

Your task is to:

1. **Categorize** every activity into: 
    * *High-Value* (strategic, creative, analytical work requiring unique expertise)
    * *Medium-Value* (necessary work, potential for assistance/delegation)
    * *Low-Value* (admin, routine coordination)
    * *Waste* (pointless meetings, interruptions, context switching)
2. **Calculate** the percentage of time spent in each category.
3. **Identify patterns:** Time-of-day correlations? Recurring time sinks? High coordination overhead activities?
4. **Flag** the "drudgery tax"—necessary but energy-draining tasks.
5. **Analyze** the gap between time allocation and perceived value creation.

**Output format:**
Output as: A summary table (Category, Time percent), a list of top 5 time consumers (Activity, Category), and specific recommendations for workflow redesign focus.
