# Phase 1: DISSOLVE (The Audit)

> "The first step is to apply that solvent consciously. You can stop treating your job as a solid block and start seeing it as a collection of elements."

## The Concept
Right now, your work likely presents itself as a solid block defined by a title (e.g., "Project Manager"). This block is actually a compressed bundle of hundreds of distinct tasks, activities, and micro-responsibilities.

AI acts as a solvent on this bundle. To manage this dissolution effectively, you must proactively break down the role yourself before the market does it for you.

## The Protocol
The goal of this phase is **granularity**. Memory is unreliable; it edits out the mechanical valleys of your day. To redesign your work, you need data.

### 1. The Activity Log
For one week (or at least 3 days), track every professional activity.
* **Avoid broad labels:** "Marketing" is too vague.
* **Be specific:** "Resizing images for social media (45 mins)" vs. "Debating subject line (15 mins)" are distinct tasks requiring different skills.
* **Capture the invisible:** Note the time spent staring at a wall thinking (strategy) vs. time spent fighting formatting (drudgery).

### 2. The Friction Signal
As you log, look for the "Friction Signal"—the moment in the day that causes the most frustration, not because the problem is hard, but because the process is inefficient.

## The Tools
Use the open-source tools in this repository to execute this phase:

1. **Deconstruct your official role:** Use `prompts/01-job-analysis.md` to analyze your formal job description and reveal the gap between your official scope and actual work.
2. **Track your actual work:** Use `templates/01-audit-log.md` to log your granular activities and identify your Friction Signals over a 3-to-7-day period.

**Next Step:** Once you have your raw log of ~150 task entries, proceed to the **ISOLATE** phase.
