# Phase 2: ISOLATE (The Sort)

> "The next step is elemental separation: separating the silicon (mechanical) from the carbon (human)."

## The Concept
Once your role is dissolved into tasks, you must sort them based on the nature of the intelligence required. This creates two distinct lists: **AI-Ready Tasks** (Silicon) and **Human Responsibilities** (Carbon).

## The Categories

### Silicon (AI-Ready Tasks)
These are tasks that follow known patterns and use structured data. They are rigid and executable.
* **Characteristics:** Accuracy matters more than interpretation; rule-based; repetitive.
* **Examples:** Data entry, report generation, scheduling, basic code debugging.
* **Goal:** Automate or delegate to an AI agent.

### Carbon (Human Responsibilities)
These are organic tasks requiring judgment, ambiguity navigation, and relational trust.
* **Characteristics:** Reading between the lines; understanding unstated context; making calls with incomplete information.
* **Examples:** Persuading a skeptic, mentoring a team member, deciding *which* problem to solve.
* **Goal:** Expand and deepen these activities.

## The Drudgery Tax
Sum the hours listed in the "Silicon" bucket. This number is your **Drudgery Tax**—the amount of your life currently spent on work that requires none of your unique talent.

## The Tools
Do not attempt to sort your task list manually. Use the open-source tools in this repository:

1. **Categorize your work:** Paste your task log into `prompts/03-silicon-carbon-sort.md`. The AI will evaluate each task based on pattern-recognition and risk, automatically sorting them into Silicon and Carbon lists for you.

**Next Step:** Use this sorted list to **SYNTHESIZE** a new workflow.
