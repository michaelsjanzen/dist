# Phase 3: SYNTHESIZE (The Blueprint)

> "You are not just identifying what to automate; you are designing new workflows where human insight and AI capability combine to produce better outcomes."

## The Concept
Many people use AI to make their *current* job slightly faster. This is a mistake. The opportunity is to fundamentally redesign *how* value gets created.

Synthesis requires you to act as an Architect. You are designing a partnership that leverages the specific strengths of both partners.

## Collaboration Patterns
Do not just hand off work. Design the interaction.

1.  **AI Executes, Human Validates:** Best for data processing or transcription. You never fully hand off; you verify the output.
2.  **Human Guides, AI Assists:** Best for drafting and design. You provide the constraints and goal; AI generates options; you refine.
3.  **Iterative Co-Creation:** Best for complex problem-solving. A back-and-forth loop where you refine the prompt based on the output.

## The Reinvestment Rule
If you save two hours on data entry, do not just do more data entry. Reinvest that time into the **Carbon** elements: deeper analysis, strategy, or relationship building.

## The Tools
Use the open-source tools in this repository to execute this phase:

1. **Blueprint the big picture:** Use `prompts/04-workflow-redesign.md` to map out a fundamentally new way to achieve your goal using AI-first logic.
2. **Design the micro-steps:** To avoid the "implementation gap," use `prompts/05-collaboration-design.md` to design the exact hand-offs and prompts you will need for your new workflow.
3. **Break your fixation:** If your new workflow feels too similar to your old one, use `prompts/06-alternative-approach.md` to force divergent thinking.

**Next Step:** Take your new workflow design and **TITRATE** it in the real world.
