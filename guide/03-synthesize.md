# Phase 3: SYNTHESIZE (The Blueprint)

> "You are not just identifying what to automate; you are designing new workflows where human insight and AI capability combine to produce better outcomes."

## The Concept
Many people use AI to make their *current* job slightly faster. This is a mistake. The opportunity is to fundamentally redesign *how* value gets created.

Synthesis requires you to act as an Architect. You are designing a partnership that leverages the specific strengths of both partners.

## Collaboration Patterns
Do not just hand off work. Design the interaction.

1.  **AI Executes, Human Validates:** Best for data processing or transcription. You never fully hand off; you verify the output.
2.  **Human Guides, AI Assists:** Best for drafting and design. You provide the constraints and goal; AI generates options; you refine.
3.  **Iterative Co-Creation:** Best for complex problem-solving. A back-and-forth loop where you refine the prompt based on the output.

## The Reinvestment Rule
If you save two hours on data entry, do not just do more data entry. Reinvest that time into the **Carbon** elements: deeper analysis, strategy, or relationship building.

**Next Step:** Take your new workflow design and **TITRATE** it in the real world.
