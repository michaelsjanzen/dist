# D.I.S.T. Sprint Plan

**Sprint Goal:** Test a new symbiotic workflow to reclaim capacity or improve quality.

## 1. The Design
* **Target Task:** [What task are you redesigning?]
* **Baseline:** [How long does it take now? What is the current error rate?]
* **Hypothesis:** "If I use [Tool/Method] to handle [Silicon Task], I will [Specific Outcome] while maintaining [Quality Standard]."

## 2. The Workflow
* **AI Role:** [What specific steps does the AI execute?]
* **Human Role:** [What specific steps do you execute?]
* **Validation Protocol:** [How will you check the AI's work? e.g., "Intern Check", "Adversarial Review"]

## 3. Daily Log

| Day | Task Run | Time Saved/Lost | Quality Check (Pass/Fail) | Notes / Hallucinations Caught |
|-----|----------|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1   |          |                 |                           |                               |
| 2   |          |                 |                           |                               |
| 3   |          |                 |                           |                               |
| 4   |          |                 |                           |                               |
| 5   |          |                 |                           |                               |

## 4. Retrospective (End of Sprint)
* **Did the hypothesis hold?** (Yes/No)
* **Did orchestration take longer than the task itself?**
* **Decision:**
    * [ ] **Adopt** (New Baseline)
    * [ ] **Modify** (Refine Prompt & Retest)
    * [ ] **Abandon** (Tool not ready)
