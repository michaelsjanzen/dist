# Template 1: The D.I.S.T. Activity Log (Phase 1: DISSOLVE)

**Purpose:** To create a granular dataset of your actual work week so the AI can analyze your role. Memory is unreliable; this log captures the reality.

**Instructions:**
1. Keep this log open on your desktop for 3 to 7 days.
2. **Be Specific:** Do not write "Project Management." Write "Compiled status update slide for engineering sync."
3. **The Friction Signal:** Mark the ONE task each day that caused the most process friction or frustration. 

| Date | Time | Specific Activity | Duration (Mins) | Notes / Friction Signal |
|------|------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
|      |      |                   |                 |                         |
|      |      |                   |                 |                         |
|      |      |                   |                 |                         |
|      |      |                   |                 |                         |

**Next Step:** Once you have 3 to 7 days of data, copy this table and paste it into **Prompt 2 (Personal Work Week Analysis)**.
