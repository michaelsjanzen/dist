# Template 3: Symbiotic Workflow Blueprint (Phase 3: SYNTHESIZE)

**Purpose:** To document the new Human-AI collaboration pattern before you begin your sprint. This serves as your "Standard Operating Procedure" (SOP) for the new way of working.

**Target Task:** [Name of the task being redesigned]

## 1. The Handoff Map
* **Step 1 (Human Input):** [What context/data do you provide to the AI?]
* **Step 2 (AI Execution):** [What specific prompt/task does the AI run? e.g., "Draft the first version," "Pull the data"]
* **Step 3 (Human Validation):** [How do you review the output? What is your validation checklist?]
* **Step 4 (Final Polish):** [What final human touches are required before completion?]

## 2. Core Prompt(s)
*Paste the exact, tested prompt(s) you will use for this workflow here.*
> "Act as a... [PASTE PROMPT]"

## 3. The Reinvestment Goal
* **Estimated Time Saved:** [e.g., 2 hours per week]
* **Carbon Reinvestment:** [Where will this saved time go? e.g., "Deep-work strategy block on Tuesday mornings"]

**Next Step:** Take this blueprint and set up your experiment using **Template 2 (Sprint Plan)**.
